          The word <strong>"react"</strong> originates from Latin, meaning "to
          perform again." It commonly refers to a response to stimuli, whether
          physical, emotional, or intellectual.

            This project began by exploring what "react" means in everyday life,
            from emotional responses to physical reactions. I then researched
            its use in software (React.js), physics, and chemistry, which gave
            me a broader perspective.
          </div>
          <div class="process-card" role="article">
            To make it more personal, I conducted small experiments, like
            observing how I reacted to different types of music and movies.
            Gathering feedback from friends and family added more depth, showing
            how people view "react" differently based on their experiences.
